                <p>The original iPhone's came from humble beginnings: a 2.0 Megapixel camera. At the time, it was nowhere near designed for taking quality photos. There isn't much more to say about this.</p>

                <h1 style="text-align: center">iPhone Photography: Now, the iPhone 14 Pro</h1>
                <p>The all-new iPhone 14 Pro is a photogenic revolution when it comes to the iPhone. With its tri-camera system, this may seem like the same old iPhone Pro edition, but in reality its the software behind it that makes it a marvel. With its amazing pixel-binding software to its 48 Megapixel main sensor, all the way to Dynamic Island and its this phone may scream futuristic, but we aren't quite there yet.</p>

                <h1 style="text-align: center">iPhone Photography: The Future</h1>
                <p>From my point of view, the iPhone camera of the future has an interchangeable lens, like a Canon EOS Series Camera. Lenses for it will be affordable and ungatekept so that other people can manufacture lenses. The base lens will be a 0-10mm main sensor, with a physical shutter. Apple really needs to start competing with flagship and concept phones from Huawei, Samsung, and Xiaomi, their main competitors. Pictured above is one of Xiaomi's concept phones, the 12S Ultra Concept is a beauty, however it could be better. The sapphire glass used in place of a proper shutter or camera cover could reduce optical transmittance. Additionally, it'd be even better if Apple made it a MIRRORLESS camera. Mirrorless cameras are the future of photography in general, and to include a mirrorless camera in an iPhone would be GROUNDBREAKING. What would be even more groundbreaking though, would be to see this release in the next 5 years.k</p>
